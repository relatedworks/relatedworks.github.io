        <p>As Donna Haraway urged in her conversation with Aryana Young, it is critical that we “open contact zones of complex entanglement where all of us are transformed by the engagement” — with other ways of knowing the world, not to produce relativism, but for other ways of knowing, intra-relationality “so that everyone in the contact zone is transformed” and “that no one view invades and dominates knowledge.” </p>
        
        <p>This suggests a important use of emerging XR/AR, and before that, VR technology - in addition to web3 as we further approach what may be considered a singularity— it can be considered our current condition and existence further transformed and merged as cyborgs with 4 dimensional knowledge— knowledge that can traverse spacetime, and be shared, intra-relationally, all at once, everywhere, and with everyone - as Haraway said, the most collective form of WE. </p>

        <p>“Reality changes. Reality is just a consensus. So as society changes, we change that consensus very quickly.” - James Turrel in conversation with Doug Aitken</p>

            <p>James Turrel’s current exhibition at Mass MOCA C.A.V.U is a critique on the rise of contemporary VR/AR art we are currently experiencing. What makes a Turrel work so powerful?  Turrel’s exhibits remain timeless unlike the ever-changing nature of technology-based VR/AR art. Instead of glorifying technology, Turrel’s work plays with our most primitive instincts. Similar to his other works, the immersive quality of his work isolates our senses through environment. In particular, one of his installation exhibited at Mass MOCA is unlike his other works. Where his other works emphasizes the use of light, this particular work highlights the lack of light. The visitor enters the dark space, their eyes forced to adjust from full gallery daylighting, to a room with no other light source other than the diffused red light of the installation itself. Much like the Skyspaces (his more commonly known work, for example: MOMA Ps1) , this installation tests human perception of edges again, however this time on the opposite end of the spectrum, the least sharp, that of complete diffusion. Our perception of depth is skewed, as well as loss of any frame of scale, other than that of our footsteps and the voices of other visitors. As we approach the wall, the illusion and trick is revealed - the exact opposite yet same move as the Skyspace - a continuously smooth curve from wall to interior, from which the diffused light spread evenly, in order to create the illusion of a perfect gradient. Again, the limitations of our fov and viewing distance tests and questions our own construction of reality, depth, including that of our own laws of physics. By viewing this body of work, we are reminded of the use of light and edge to accentuate/de-emphasize, expand/contract, focus/diffuse new realities. With a more refined knowledge of these two materials/conditions (light and edge), coupled with a fuller knowledge of how inhabitants (human or other) perceive their own realities, what those limitations are, and how those limitations can create something out of nothing. Likewise, the lack of one sense intensified our other senses. Entering the room gives an awareness to the visitors hearing. The room itself has an echo effect. Adding to the already disorienting space, as you approach the wall the sound became louder. This installation perplexes the senses in many and unexplainable ways. </p>
            
            <p>Commenting on Turrel’s timelessness this installation draws on similar techniques already discussed in prior centuries. For example, the paper architect, Etienne Louis Boulee’s Cenotaph to Newton used similar environmental techniques to heightened senses.</p>
            
            <p>Turrel’s exhibit remains timeless by focusing on the most primitive tools such as our senses. He questions and further reveals how our own technology works, rather than glorify new technology that derives its function from individual biased interpretation of the technology.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, the question remains, can media art using new age VR/AR technologies today achieve the same affects and timelessness? Should media art continue to be about the technology? </p>
